# OOP

This folder contains programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.

## Files

- **Parent.java**: Defines a Parent class with public and default methods, and demonstrates method calling.
- **Child.java**: Defines a Child class that extends Parent, includes a constructor, and demonstrates inheritance.
- **SubClass.java**: An empty subclass (likely a placeholder for future OOP examples).
